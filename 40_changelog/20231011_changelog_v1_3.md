**Version 1.3**

_Bug fixes:_
- Adjusted identification of evaluation time time2Eval

_Log File:_
- Finalized evalLogFiles script for data availability evaluation (Output of 4 plots possible)

_Data import:_
- Deactivated HIW & GPS import (not needed for VHM0 insitu-adjustments)


_Visualization:_
- Changed figure size to fixed position in centimeters:  [0    1.0583   50.8000   25.4794]
- Changed interpreter for heatmaps to latex
- Changed CellLabelFormat for heatmaps to %.2f to always show 2 decimal digits. Uniform fontsize for all cells is not possible because of non writable scaling. Deviations >+-10 (or 100 for NOR) can lead to different fontSizes between heatmaps.
- Added lineWidth property lw in spatialPlot. New creation of box around spatialPlot (xline and yline at limits). lw also determines linewidth for coastlines
- Changed contour line style for contourf plot to dottet line (':')
- Moved colorbar to 'southotside'. BSH 4/3 format lead to automatic scaling issues. Figure will now automatically be set to BSH default size and due to horizontally aranged colorbar the map can be better postioned compared to the subplots on the right hand side.
- Added functions for two warning infoboxes, if deviation between WAM-Insitu is too high or when crucial site data is missing

_Batch:_


_Scripts:_
- Added function plotboxpos to identify actual axes positions for infoBox
