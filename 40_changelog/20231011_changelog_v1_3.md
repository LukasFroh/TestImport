**Version 1.3**

_Bug fixes:_


_Log File:_


_Data import:_



_Visualization:_
- Changed figure size to fixed position in centimeters:  [0    1.0583   50.8000   25.4794]
- Changed interpreter for heatmaps to latex
- Changed CellLabelFormat for heatmaps to %.2f to always show 2 decimal digits. Uniform fontsize for all cells is not possible because of non writable scaling. Deviations >+-10 (or 100 for NOR) can lead to different fontSizes between heatmaps.


_Batch:_


_Scripts:_
- Added function plotboxpos to identify actual axes positions for infoBox
