**Version 1.5**

_New Features:_
- Added dummy mode for testing purposes at a fixed point in time (2024-03-22 21:45:00). Dummy mode can be activated/deactivated by switching boolean either 
in batch-file or testSastateMasterFnc.m between 1 (true) and 0 (false). Therefore a new directory ...\50_dummyData was created, where forecast and insitu files 
for chosen date a saved. This data is also available via GitLab/GitHub and make the module assessable for externals.
- Implemented export booleans for figures and data export (zipped .csv & .mat)

_Bug fixes:_


_Log File:_


_Data import:_
- BSH stations are gradually being upgraded to new Datawell software _Waves5_. HIS & GPS output will then have timestamps describing the begin of the measuring period instead of describing the end of measuring period (prior version). A new if-condition is implemented in the seastateModule which checks, whether the input data is processed with the new or old Datawell software. The timestamp for both versions is then adjusted to the middle of the measuring period afterwards. 


_Visualization:_


_Batch:_
- Added the variable _d1_ for activating/deactivating the dummy mode
- Added variables _e1_, _e2_, _e3_ (Export Booleans) 
- Created batch-file for dummyMode (predefined path endings)


_Scripts:_
- Optimization of compilation script _compileSeastateFnc.m_: Only base path and output filename (.exe) mandatory. Also .txt cleanup afterwards implemented
