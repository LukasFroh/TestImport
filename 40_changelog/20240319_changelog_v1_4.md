**Version 1.4**

_Bug fixes:_
- Fixed issue with function _plt_highDeviationWarningBox.m_
- Insitu Hs values of "0" will be replaced with "nan" to avoid Inf values for scaling and relative deviation (fnc: OR_CalculateScaleData)
- Fixed issue with min qf consideration (fnc: imp_cleanQFdata)

_Log File:_


_Data import:_


_Visualization:_
- Legend for Insitu/WAM barplot (top-right) shows now either CWAM or EWAM and not only WAM, based on which model is used
- "Blanking" for rel. deviation heamtap occured, if any deviation was > 100%. Now all rel. deviations are rounded to integers and a precision of 0 (digits after decimal point) is set.
- Site names (that exceeds rel. deviation threshold) are now also shown in warning box
- Added second optional figure output with higher colormap resolution for specified Hs range. Range is defined in Batch file.

_Batch:_
- Added two parameters (f14 & f15) that define whether high resolution cm figure is created or not and the corresponding upper limit for the Hs range. 

_Scripts:_
